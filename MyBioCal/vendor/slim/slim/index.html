					<p class="label">Bisphenol A</p>
					<p>Biomonitoring of urinary environmental phenols and parabens
						is used to determine their prevalence in humans and the relevance
						of human exposure in public health. The sources of human exposure
						to these phenolic compounds include industrial pollution,
						pesticide use, food and bottled water, and personal care products.
						Specifically, bisphenol A (BPA) is used in the manufacture of
						polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins, which have been used in
						baby bottles, as protective coatings on food containers, and as
						composites and sealants in dentistry (Detection Limit: 0.4 ug/L).</p>

					<p class="label">Lead</p>
					<p>Lead is a known environmental toxin that has been shown to
						deleteriously affect the nervous, hematopoietic, endocrine, renal,
						and reproductive systems. In young children, lead exposure is a
						particular hazard because children more readily absorb lead than
						do adults, and children’s developing nervous systems also make
						them more susceptible to the effects of lead. The primary sources
						of exposure for children are lead-laden paint chips and dust as a
						result of deteriorating lead-based paint. The risk for lead
						exposure is disproportionately higher for children who are poor,
						non-Hispanic black, living in large metropolitan areas, or living
						in older housing. Among adults, the most common high exposure
						sources are occupational. Blood lead levels measured in previous
						NHANES programs have been the cornerstone of lead exposure
						surveillance in the U.S. The data have been used to document the
						burden and dramatic decline of elevated blood lead levels, to
						promote the reduction of lead use, and to help to redefine
						national lead poisoning prevention guidelines, standards, and
						abatement activities.</p>

					<p class="label">Mercury</p>
					<p>Uncertainties exist regarding levels of exposure to methyl
						mercury from fish consumption and potential health effects
						resulting from this exposure. Past estimates of exposure to methyl
						mercury have been obtained from results of food consumption
						surveys and measures of methyl mercury in fish. Measures of a
						biomarker of exposure are needed for improved exposure
						assessments. Blood mercury levels will be assessed in two
						subpopulations particularly vulnerable to the health effects from
						mercury exposure: children 1–5 years old and women of childbearing
						age. Blood measures of total and inorganic mercury will be
						important for evaluation of exposure from exposure to mercury in
						interior latex paints</p>

					<p class="label">Cotinine</p>
					<p>Cotinine is a major metabolite of nicotine that may be used
						as a marker for both active smoking, and as an index to
						Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS) exposure, or "passive smoking".
						Cotinine is generally preferred over nicotine for such assessments
						because of its substantially longer half-life. The half-life of
						cotinine in plasma has been estimated to be about 15–20 hrs;1–3 by
						contrast, the half-life of nicotine is only 0.5–3 hrs.4-6 Cotinine
						may be measured in serum, urine or saliva – the half-life of
						cotinine in all three fluids is essentially the same. Cotinine
						concentrations tend to be higher (3–8×) in urine than in serum;
						however, for studies requiring a quantitative assessment of
						exposure, plasma or serum is regarded as the fluid of choice (Detection Limit: 0.015 ng/mL).</p>

					<p>Organochlorine pesticides, an older class of pesticides, are
						effective against a variety of insects. These chemicals were
						introduced in the 1940s, and many of their uses have been
						cancelled or restricted by the U.S. EPA because of their
						environmental persistence and potential adverse effects on
						wildlife and human health. Many organochlorines are no longer used
						widely in the U.S., but other countries continue to use them.</p>

					<p class="label">Polychlorinated Biphenyls</p>
					<p>Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a class of chlorinated
						aromatic hydrocarbon chemicals that once were used as
						heat-exchanger, transformer, and hydraulic fluids, and as
						additives to paints, oils, joint caulking, and floor tiles. The
						different types of PCB chemicals are known as congeners, which are
						compounds that are distinguished by the number of chlorine atoms
						and their location on the biphenyl structure. Peak production
						occurred in the early 1970s, and production was banned in the
						United States after 1979. More than 1.5 billion pounds of PCBs
						were manufactured in the United States prior to 1977. Continued
						concern about these chemicals is because of their persistence in
						the environment and accumulation in wildlife and the animal food
						chain. PCBs enter the food chain by a variety of routes, including
						migration into food from external sources, contamination of animal
						feeds, and accumulation in the fatty tissues of animals. PCBs are
						found at higher concentrations in fatty foods (e.g., dairy
						products and fish) and food is the main source of exposure for the
						general population. The transfer of PCBs from mother to infant via
						breast milk is another important source of exposure. Exposure to
						these chemicals nearly always occurs as mixtures rather than as
						individual PCBs.</p>

					<p class="label">PDE-47</p>
					<p>Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and
						2,2’,4,4’,5,5’-hexabromobiphenyl (PBB-153) are included in a
						larger group of chemicals known as brominated flame retardants
						(BFRs) that are added to products such as foam padding, textiles,
						or plastics to retard combustion. BFRs are not chemically bound to
						the flame-retarded material, so they can enter the environment
						from volatilization, leaching, or degradation of BFR-containing
						products. PBDEs are generally persistent in the environment and
						have been measured in aquatic sediments, house dust, and aquatic
						and terrestrial animals. PBDEs have been shown to bioaccumulate in
						fish. Humans may be exposed though the diet, including breast
						feeding, and by contact with BFR-treated products and contaminated
						house dust. The elimination rate of these BFRs from the human body
						depends on the specific PBDE congener and can vary from a few
						weeks to several months. PBB-153 has an elimination half-life
						measured in decades (Detection Limit: 37 ng/g).</p>

					<p class="label">Insesticides</p>
					<p>Organophosphorus insecticides, which are active against a
						broad spectrum of insects, have accounted for a large share of all
						insecticides used in the United States. Although organophosphorus
						insecticides are still used for insect control on many food crops,
						most residential uses have been phased out in the United States as
						a result of implementation of the Food Quality Protection Act of
						1996. Pesticide residues and their metabolites in human tissues
						and fluids can be indicative of pesticide exposure and the total
						body burden of these pesticides. About 75% of registered
						organophosphorus insecticides are metabolized in the body to
						measurable dialkyl phosphate (DAP) metabolites. Dialkyl phosphates
						may also occur in the environment as a result of degradation of
						organophosphorus insecticides, and therefore, the presence in a
						person’s urine may reflect exposure to the metabolite itself (Detection Limit: 0.56 mg/l).</p>

					<p class="label">Phthalates and Plasticizers (DEHP: Mono-2-ethyl-hexyl-phthalate)</p>
					<p>Phthalate acid esters (phthalates) have been used
						extensively as plasticizers in a wide range of applications such
						as children’s toys, food packaging, personal care products, and
						medical supplies. Because some of these compounds have been shown
						to bind to estrogen receptors and have been associated with
						estrogenic effects in laboratory animals, increasing concerns have
						been expressed about phthalate usage in food packaging materials,
						personal care products, and children’s toys. Measurement of
						urinary phthalate metabolites in humans is useful to evaluate
						recent exposure and potential human health effects from these
						chemicals (Detection Limit: 0.5 ng/mL).</p>

					<p>Age in years, at the time of the screening interview, is
						reported for survey participants between the ages of 1 and 79
						years of age. All responses of participants aged 80 years and
						older are coded as ‘80.’ The reporting of age in single years for
						adults 80 years and older was determined to be a disclosure risk.
						RIDAGEYR was calculated based on the participant’s date of birth.
